Sometimes you see something that catches your eye and you have to find out more. This is what happened when I saw the Github page for [Thomas Anderson](https://github.com/Driminary/thomas-anderson.net). I saw a beautiful sketch of his web site architecture, shown below in all it's glory, a 2.4MB PNG file.

It was made with [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), which I had never heard of before. What I liked about it was the casual, almost manual sketch appearance. It reminded me of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) theme I saw called Theme UI Sketchy Preset [Theme UI Sketchy Preset](https://github.com/beerose/theme-ui-sketchy).

That's all I got.
